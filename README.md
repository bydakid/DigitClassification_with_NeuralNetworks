# Digit  
**Handwritten Digit Recognition Web App**  
Digit is an interactive web application that recognizes handwritten digits. Users can draw a number (0–9) directly on the canvas, and the app predicts the digit using a deep learning model—demonstrating practical applications of machine learning in a fun, user-friendly way.

## About

### Project Goal  
To build an intuitive browser-based tool that lets users test their handwriting and see real-time digit classification powered by a trained neural network.

## Theme Inspiration  
Inspired by classic MNIST examples, this project aims to bridge the gap between algorithmic models and everyday interactions, making AI accessible and engaging.

## Key Features  
- **Live Drawing Canvas** – Freehand input for users to write digits  
- **Real-Time Prediction** – Instant classification with confidence scores  
- **Clean UI** – Minimalist interface highlighting model performance  
- **Interactive Feedback** – Shows users what the model sees and predicts

## Technologies Used  
- **Frontend**: HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript  
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow.js (or equivalent)  
- **Model**: Pre-trained convolutional neural network (e.g. trained on MNIST)  
- **Hosting**: Static web hosting via GitHub Pages / Netlify (or similar)
